# Regulatory network topology and the genetic architecture of gene expression

This is the code repository for "[Regulatory network topology and the genetic architecture of gene expression](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.08.12.669924)" (Aguirre <i>et. al.</i>, <i>bioRxiv</i> 2025). We provide this analysis code as a resource to the community for reproducibility and future work on modeling regulatory networks.

The primary analysis code is in the `src` directory. It includes scripts to produce synthetic networks from different random graph models (`dag.py`), to run simulation experiments used in the study, and to process raw data.

Jupyter notebooks used to perform statistical analysis and produce the main and supplementary figures and tables can be found in the `figures` directory. Each notebook corresponds to one of the main figures in the manuscript.

Please direct questions about this repository to Matthew Aguirre (magu [at] stanford [dot] edu).
